# Project `JigsawQuickStartGreetings`

Greetings!

_Inspired by Project Jigsaw: Module System Quick-Start Guide._

This example is a module named `com.greetings` that simply prints `Greetings!`.
The module consists of two source files: the module declaration (`module-info.java`) and the main class.

By convention, the source code for the module is in a directory that is  the name of the module.
